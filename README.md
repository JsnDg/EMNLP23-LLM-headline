# Dataset of Harnessing the Power of LLMs: Evaluating Human-AI Text Co-Creation through the Lens of News Headline Generation (EMNLP'23)

This repository contains datasets used in the research paper ["Harnessing the Power of LLMs: Evaluating Human-AI Text Co-Creation through the Lens of News Headline Generation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10706.pdf), presented at EMNLP'23.

# Documentation

The repository has two datasets: 1) news_headlines.csv, 840 headlines generated from 6 conditions (2 baseline conditions x 20 articles + 4 human conditions x 20 articles x 10 participant per condition); and 2) ranked_news_headlines.csv, 2400 ratings of those 840 headlines (20 articles x 6 conditions x 20 evaluators).

### Conditions
2 baseline conditions
- Con 0: Original - Headlines used by online media.
- Con 1: GPT-generated - Headlines generated by GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002).

4 human conditions
- Con 2: Manual only - The participant writes the news headline without any AI assistance.
- Con 3: Selection - The LLM generates three headlines for each news article (generate headlines), and the user selects the most appropriate one.
- Con 4: Guidance + Selection - The LLM extracts several potential perspectives (keywords) from each news article (extract perspectives), the user chooses one or more perspectives to emphasize in the headline, the LLM then generates three headlines for each news article based on the selected perspectives (generate headlines w/ perspectives), and finally, the user selects the best one.
- Con 5: Perspective space + headline space + post-editing - This is similar to Guidance + Selection, but the user can further edit the selected headline (post-editing).
