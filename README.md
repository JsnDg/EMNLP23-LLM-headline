# Dataset of Harnessing the Power of LLMs: Evaluating Human-AI Text Co-Creation through the Lens of News Headline Generation (EMNLP'23)

This repository contains datasets used in the research paper "Harnessing the Power of LLMs: Evaluating Human-AI Text Co-Creation through the Lens of News Headline Generation," presented at EMNLP'23.

# Documentation

The repository has two datasets, 1) news_headlines, 840 headlines generated from 6 conditions (2 baseline conditions x 20 articles + 4 human conditions x 20 articles x 10 participant per condition); and 2) ranked_news_headlines, 2400 ratings of those 840 headlines (20 articles x 6 conditions x 20 evaluators).


### Conditions
2 baseline conditions
- Headlines used by online media
- Headlines generated by GPT-3

4 human conditions
- Headlines written by professionals
- Headline space only
- Perspective space + headline space
- Perspective space + headline space + post-editing
